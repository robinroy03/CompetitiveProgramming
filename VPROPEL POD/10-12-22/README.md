# Pricipal Numbers
A proper factor of a number is a factor of the number other than itself. Given a collection of numbers, a number n1 in position ‘i’ is said to be principal number if the largest proper factor of all numbers in position > i is lesser than or equal to the largest proper factor of n1. The last number in the collection is a principal number. For example, given five numbers 29, 15, 5, 9 and 11, the output should be 15, 9 and 11.
