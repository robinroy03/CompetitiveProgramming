# Non-triangle triplet
In a triangle, sum of the lengths of two sides should be greater than the length of the third side.  A triplet of integers is a collection of three integers. For eg., (1,2,3) is a triplet of integers. The triplets (1,2,3)   (2,3,1) , (3,1,2), are considered to be the same triplets. Given a positive integer N, Write a code to compute all the distinct triplets (a,b,c) such that a+b+c = N and the triplet (a,b,c) does not form the length of sides of  a triangle. If N=5, of the two possible triplets: (1,1,3), (1,2,2), the triplet (1,1,3) does not form the sides of a triangle.

Triangle Rule : lengths of any two sides of a triangle must add up to more than the length of the third side.

### Input format:

Enter the number N

### Output Format :

Number of  distinct triplets (a,b,c) such that a+b+c=N and the triplet (a,b,c) does not form the sides of a triangle.
