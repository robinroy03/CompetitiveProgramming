# Sliding Friction
Sliding friction is contact force generated when an object moves over a surface. Few wooden blocks of different heights are put in a room. An experiment is to be carried over in which a ball has to roll up and down over a steps like structure. The experimenter wishes to find the maximum size of the steps structure present in the wooden block and he prefers to have a step up operation from left to right. Given the height of the wooden blocks arranged in the room, write a code to find the starting and ending position of the wooden blocks that can form a steps structure. When more than one steps structure of same maximum size is available consider the one that comes first from left to right.
```
Example 1

Heights = 5 6 3 5 7 8 9 1 2

Longest step up structure from left to right is

3 5 7 8 9

and positions are from 3 to 7

Heights = 12 13 1 5 4 7 8 10 10 11

Longest step up structure from left to right is

4 7 8 10

and positions are from 5 to 8
```

### Input Format

First line contains the number of wooden blocks, n

Next line contains the height of the wooden blocks separated by a space

### Output Format
