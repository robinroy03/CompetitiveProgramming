# Minimum Multiple
Given a collection C1 of ‘n’ positive integers and a number ‘m’ write a program to find the minimum multiple of m in C1. If no such multiple exist in C1 then print ‘No multiple found’
```
For example, if there are seven elements 23, 24, 25, 12, 6, 7, 11 and m is 3 then the output should be 6.
```
### Input Format

First line contains the number of elements in the collection C1, n

Next ‘n’ lines contain the elements in the collection C1

Next line contains the value of m

### Output Format

Print the minimum multiple of ‘m’ present in C1 or ‘No multiple found’
