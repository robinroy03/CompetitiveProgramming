# Smallest Divisible Number
Given an integer ‘n’ where n>=1, write code to check whether there exist a smallest number ‘S’, where S<=107 and S is divisible by all even numbers ‘m’ where 1<=m<=n.

For example, when n = 10, the smallest number divisible by all even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 is 120. If no such number exist then print ‘No such number in range’.

### Input Format

First line contains the number, n

### Output Format

Print either the number that is divisible by all even numbers less than ‘n’ or print No such number in range
