# Maxpower
A new operation called maxpower, among two real numbers x , y, denoted by ***, is defined as follows.

x *** y = z, where y^z =x.

x *** y is the power to which a number y must be raised in order to get x.
```
100 *** 10 = 2 , since 10 ^ 2 = 100.

2 *** 10 = 0.3010, since 10 ^0.3010 = 1.99 = 2 (approximately), when rounded-off to the nearest integer,

10 *** 2 = 3.3219 since 2^3.3219 = 9.99=10 (approximately), when rounded-off to the nearest integer.

64 *** 4 = 3, since 4^3=64.

1.44 *** 1.2 = 2, since 1.2^2= 1.44
```
Given two real numbers x and y, write a code to print the value of x *** y with two decimal places only.

### Boundary Conditions

x, y >= 0

### Input format:

The first line is the number x.

The second line is the number y

### Output format

Value of the x *** y with two decimal places only
