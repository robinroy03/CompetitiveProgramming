# Win in a Board Game
In a board game, a pXp board is given and the cells of the board are numbered as follows.

|    |    |    |    |
|----|----|----|----|
|3, 0|3, 1|3, 2|3, 3|
|2, 0|2, 1|2, 2|2, 3|
|1, 0|1, 1|1, 2|1, 3|
|0, 0|0, 1|0, 2|0, 3|

The movement of the coin in the board allowed are left, right, up and down. The coin movements are defined in the below table:

|Movement|Current Position|Position after move|
|:------:|:--------------:|:-----------------:|
|Left|m, n|m, n-1 if n>0<br>m, n otherwise|
|Right|m, n|m, n+1 if n<p-1<br>m, n otherwise|
|Up|m, n|m+1, n if m<p-1<br>m, n otherwise|
|Down|m, n|m-1, n if m>0<br>m, n otherwise|


Given a size the board, p, initial cell of the coin in the board, a list of movements and a winning cell in the board, write a code to check if the coin reaches the winning cell from initial cell by these movements. If the winning position is reached then print Win and print Loss otherwise.
