# Substrings without Vowels
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Given a string S and an integer n, write a code to generate all substrings of length n without vowels. For example, if the given string S1 is ‘apple’ then substrings of S1 of length 3 are app, ppl, pple. And substrings of length 3 without vowels is only one and it is ppl.
```
Note:

In C language when a string is prepared by programmer by putting characters in a character array, 
he has to place a ‘\0’ (null character) at the end explicitly
```
### Boundary Conditions

length of the string s <=20 without spaces

n>0 and n<length of s

There is atleast one substring of length n without vowels

### Input Format

First line contains a string, S in lower case

Next line contains an integer, n

### Output Format

Print substrings of length n without vowels

One substring in one line
