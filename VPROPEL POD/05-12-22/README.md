# Find the Lucky Kids

In a game for kids under age seven, m\*n kids are made to sit in a room where there are ‘n’ chairs arranged in ‘m’ rows. The game organizers has got ‘m\*n’ chits in which either one of the two numbers ‘p’ or ‘q’ is written. Each kid is asked to pick a chit. A lot is taken by the coordinator which contains the lucky number ‘l’ (Value of 'l' will be either 'p' or 'q'). Then it is declared that “Chit Transition” takes place for few kids. If the lucky number ‘l’ is equal to ‘p’, during chit transition, a kid ‘k’, sitting in the row ‘r’ and column ‘c’ with number ‘p’ is given ‘q’ when one of the following criteria is satisfied:

* (i) If atleast one of the kid sitting in the row ‘r’ has ‘q’

* (ii) If atleast one of the kid sitting in the column ‘c’ has ‘q’

After this Chit transition phase, the kids with number ‘p’ are declared as winners. For example, if there are 3*3 kids, chit numbers as 3 and 5 seated with original chit number as follows:

3 5 3

3 3 3

3 5 5

If the lucky number taken by coordinator is 3 then the chit number of the kids after “Chit Transition” phase will be:

5 5 5

3 5 5

5 5 5

Now the kid sitting in the second row and first column is the winner. Sometimes there can be more than one winner in this game and sometimes there may not be any winner in this game also. Print the row and column position of all the winning kids and when there are no winners print ‘No winner’.
