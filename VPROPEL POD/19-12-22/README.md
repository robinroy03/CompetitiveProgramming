# Rectangle equivalent to Square
Given  the area (an integer) of a square (a closed polygon with four sides whose lengths are same), write an algorithm and the code to compute the number of rectangles ( a closed polygon with fours sides, whose opposite sides are of same length and  lenght of the adjacent sides are not same) that can be formed whose area is equal to the area of the given square. The dimensions of a rectangle are called as length of the rectangle(an integer) and the breadth of the rectangle (an integer), represented by 'lengthX breadth'.  The dimension of a rectangle with lenghth 4 units and breadth 2 units is written as 4X2. Area of a rectangle is the product of the length and the breadth of the rectangle.  For exampe, if the area of the square is 36 sqaure units, the possible rectangles that can be formed whose area is 36 square units are:  rectangles with dimension : 36X1, 18X2, 12X3, 9X4.  The rectangles with the dimension 18X2 and the rectangle with the dimension 2X18 are considered as the same rectangle. Hence, for the given square with area 36 square units, four rectangles can be formed.  

### Input format:

Enter the area of the square

### Output format:

Number of rectangles that can be formed, whose area is equal to the given area.
